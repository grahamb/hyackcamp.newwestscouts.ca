Welcome to Hyack Camp 2025. Whether this is your first time at Hyack, or you’re a veteran, we’re thrilled you’ll be joining us for the 38th Hyack Camp.

## Registration
Registration for Hyack Camp 2025 will go live at **noon on Saturday, March 22, 2025**. Due to the physical constraints of the camp site, registration for Hyack is capped at 200 participants (including Scouters). We are expecting a full camp this year with a possible waitlist.

Unfortunately, last year saw a number of groups either not show up at all, or dramatically reduce their numbers without informing us. This resulted in groups who were on the waitlist not being able to get in, and affected our costs for items purchased in advance. In order to make it possible for as many groups to attend Hyack as possible, we are implementing the following registration procedure this year:

- All groups must pre-register. There is no on-site registration.
- Full payment must be received in order to confirm your registration. We're happy to offer online payments via credit card this year.
- No refunds will be provided (if you have extenuating circumstances, get in touch and we'll discuss).

Once your group's registration request is confirmed, you'll be emailed with payment instructions. Your registration will be considered confirmed once your payment has been processed.

## Location and Arrivals
Hyack Camp is located in Queen’s Park in New Westminster. The campsite is located at the corner of [First Street and Vancouver Street](https://goo.gl/maps/MWfxFmqBGe4Gq2zT7).

You can arrive any time after 5:00 PM on Friday. Please check in at our headquarters tent before you start to set up your campsite. We will confirm your numbers and direct you to your assigned site. The area of the park we're using is undergoing active habitat rehabilitation, so there are numerous areas that we have had access to in the past that we can not use this year. We are also expecting a full camp this year. Please be as compact as possible with your campsite setup.

## Parking
Parking directly around the camp site is **extremely limited**. The site borders on the parade route, so there will be numerous parking restrictions. Pay attention to all posted signage. The camp is not responsible if your vehicle is towed – and yes, it has happened before. For the groups closer to New Westminster, please encourage your Scouts to carpool. You will likely have to drop off your equipment and find parking in the nearby neighbourhood streets or in some of the parking lots throughout Queens Park (again, **check all posted signage**). We suggest that you leave a note on your dash with your name and phone number in case your vehicle needs to be moved.
