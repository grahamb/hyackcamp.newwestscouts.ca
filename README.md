Welcome to Hyack Camp 2025. Whether this is your first time at Hyack, or you’re a veteran, we’re thrilled you’ll be joining us for the 38th Hyack Camp.

## Registration
Registration for Hyack Camp 2025 will go live at **noon on Saturday, March 22, 2025**. Due to the physical constraints of the camp site, registration for Hyack is capped at 200 participants (including Scouters). We are expecting a full camp this year with a possible waitlist.

Unfortunately, last year saw a number of groups either not show up at all, or dramatically reduce their numbers without informing us. This resulted in groups who were on the waitlist not being able to get in, and affected our costs for items purchased in advance. In order to make it possible for as many groups to attend Hyack as possible, we are implementing the following registration procedure this year:

- All groups must pre-register. There is no on-site registration.
- Full payment must be received in order to confirm your registration. We're happy to offer online payments via credit card this year.
- No refunds will be provided (if you have extenuating circumstances, get in touch and we'll discuss).

Once your group's registration request is confirmed, you'll be emailed with payment instructions. Your registration will be considered confirmed once your payment has been processed.
