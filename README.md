Welcome to Hyack Camp 2025. Whether this is your first time at Hyack, or you’re a veteran, we’re thrilled you’ll be joining us for the 38th Hyack Camp.

The theme this year is **Conspiracy Camp** (yes, the Venturers picked it). Bust out your tinfoil hats, and get ready to convince us that Elvis is still alive and well.

## Registration
Registration for Hyack Camp 2025 will go live at **noon on Saturday, March 22, 2025**. Due to the physical constraints of the camp site, registration for Hyack is capped at 200 participants (including Scouters). We are expecting a full camp this year with a possible waitlist. Fees are being finalized but expected to be in the $20-30 per person range (including Scouters).

Unfortunately, last year saw a number of groups either not show up at all, or dramatically reduce their numbers without informing us. This resulted in groups who were on the waitlist not being able to get in, affected our costs for items purchased in advance, and caused a fair amount of food waste from extra perishable lunch supplies. 

**In order to make it possible for as many groups to attend Hyack as possible, we are implementing the following registration procedure this year**:

- All groups must pre-register. There is no on-site registration.
- Full payment must be received in order to confirm your registration. We're happy to offer online payments via credit card this year.
- No refunds will be provided (if you have extenuating circumstances, get in touch and we'll discuss).

Once your group's registration request is confirmed, you'll be emailed with payment instructions. Your registration will be considered confirmed once your payment has been processed.

## Location and Arrivals
Hyack Camp is located in Queen’s Park in New Westminster. The campsite is located at the corner of [First Street and Vancouver Street](https://goo.gl/maps/MWfxFmqBGe4Gq2zT7).

You can arrive any time after 5:00 PM on Friday. Please check in at our headquarters tent before you start to set up your campsite. We will confirm your numbers and direct you to your assigned site. The area of the park we're using is undergoing active habitat rehabilitation, so there are numerous areas that we have had access to in the past that we can not use this year. We are also expecting a full camp this year. Please be as compact as possible with your campsite setup.

## Parking
Parking directly around the camp site is **extremely limited**. The site borders on the parade route, so there will be numerous parking restrictions. Pay attention to all posted signage. The camp is not responsible if your vehicle is towed – and yes, it has happened before. For the groups closer to New Westminster, please encourage your Scouts to carpool. You will likely have to drop off your equipment and find parking in the nearby neighbourhood streets or in some of the parking lots throughout Queens Park (again, **check all posted signage**). We suggest that you leave a note on your dash with your name and phone number in case your vehicle needs to be moved.

## Water and Waste Management
In 2023, the City removed our usual water source. We have access to potable water, but it’s a bit of a distance. **We are looking for groups to volunteer to bring garden hoses**. In order to run the campfire, we must run water to the fire location in case of emergency. If you can bring a labelled length of hose, it would be greatly appreciated.

Grey water disposal is located along the fence line on Vancouver street. There will be a marked path to the drain. Please filter out any large chunks of food and debris. **NO DISHWASHING AT THE TAP OR GREY WATER PIT**.

Outhouses, a handwash station, and waste disposal bins are located on the path near camp HQ. **Keeping the outhouses clean is a shared responsibility**; please be respectful of your fellow campers and the camp staff. If an outhouse needs attention, please let us know at camp HQ.

## Hyack Parade
One of the main features of Hyack Camp is the Hyack International Parade. The parade attracts entrants from Canada and the US and passes right by our campsite. We participate in the parade as a marching unit (well, really a "loose gaggle of walking" unit). Bring your group flags and banners. The parade is rain or shine, and as past participants know, it can do either with vigour. Be Prepared!

As well as marching in the parade, we provide a number of Scouts to the parade to assist with holding signs either in the parade or along the route. We will ask for volunteers at opening on Saturday. Get those uniforms spiffy!

## Saturday Lunch
Lunch after the parade is provided by the camp. We will be serving cold-cut sandwiches. If you have participants with dietary restrictions, we suggest having alternatives for them. We may be able to make some accommodations, but you know your youth and fellow Scouters best.

## Camp Activities
We'll have all our usual Hyack Camp favourites, including bubble soccer, boffing, and human fooseball. There will be an on-site scavenger hunt, and we're working on some new exiting activities as well.

## Cooking Competition
Put your camp culinary skills to the test, and you could claim your place on the Coveted Hyack Cooking Trophy! As is tradition, your group will be provided with a secret ingredient which you will incorporate into your dinner on Saturday night. Judging criteria includes creativity, taste, appearance, and food safety. You will be provided with a labelled paper plate upon which to submit your entry.

## Campfire
Perhaps the ultimate highlight of Hyack is our Saturday night campfire on the baseball diamond. The City of New Westminster issues exactly one fire permit per year, and it goes to us! In order to receive the secret ingredient for the cooking competition, you must provide us with your song, skit, and cheer.. Bring your campfire blanket and chair, unless you want to sit on the ground. 
Mug up is immediately following the campfire and is provided by the camp.

## Other Information
- Each group is responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with all Scouts Canada policies and procedures, including AAFs and ensuring all participants are Active in MyScouts. You are responsible for your own first aid requirements.
- No open fires are permitted. **This includes propane fires in your site.**
